Bugfixing testing:
OVS-1330:
  Creating a volume (from image) with volume size smaller than the
 virtual_size of the image before conversion fails with error
 "Message objects do not support str() because they may contain non-ascii
 characters. Please use unicode() or translate() instead. " due to logging
 in OVSVolumeDriver doing str(ex)
 Test:
  - create volume (of size 1GB) from fedora image (virtual size = 2GB)
 Expect RuntimeError, investigate actual error.
